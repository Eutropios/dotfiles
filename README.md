These are my config files for system-essential or widely-popular programs.  

Looking for my NeoVim config? It can be found [here](https://github.com/Eutropios/Neovim-config).

I use zsh on my system, and the lightweight, ultra-fast zimfw plugin manager.  
I have included my outdated bashrc file for backup purposes.

If you would like to use my zshrc without zimfw, please remove the relevant
lines of code in zshrc.

## Installation

### `.zshrc` and `zimfw`

To install both my `.zshrc` and zimfw configs, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Move `.zimrc`, `.zshrc` and `.zsh_aliases` to your home directory.
3. Restart your shell.
