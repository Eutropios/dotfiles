# Shells

Here you can find my shell configs. I use zsh on my system, and the lightweight, ultra-fast zimfw plugin manager.  
I have included my outdated bashrc file for backup purposes.

If you would like to use my zshrc without zimfw, please remove the relevant lines of code in zshrc.

## Installation

### `.zshrc` and `zimfw`

To install both my `.zshrc` and zimfw configs, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Move `.zshrc` and `.zsh_aliases` to your home directory.
3. Follow the manual installation steps to install zimfw [here](https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw), using my `.zimrc` file where it asks you to create a `.zimrc` file.
4. Restart your shell
