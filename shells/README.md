# Shells

Here you can find my shell configs. I use zsh on my system, and the lightweight, ultra-fast zimfw plugin manager.  
I have included my outdated bashrc file for backup purposes.

If you would like to use my zshrc without zimfw, please remove the relevant lines of code in zshrc.

## Installation

### `.zshrc` and `zimfw`

To install both my `.zshrc` and zimfw configs, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Move `.zimrc`, `.zshrc` and `.zsh_aliases` to your home directory.
3. Restart your shell.
